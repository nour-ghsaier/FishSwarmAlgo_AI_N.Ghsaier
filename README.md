# Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm

The **Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm** is a nature-inspired optimization technique that mimics the social behavior of fish in a swarm. This algorithm is designed to solve complex optimization problems by exploring the solution space effectively.

---

## Algorithm Explanation

The Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm operates based on the following principles:

### 1. Swarm Intelligence
Each fish represents a potential solution and interacts with other fish to explore the solution space.

### 2. Movement
Fish adjust their positions based on their own experience and the experience of their neighbors.

### 3. Convergence
The swarm converges towards the optimal solution through iterative updates.
